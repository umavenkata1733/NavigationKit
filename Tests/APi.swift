Layered Architecture for Benefits & Coverage Dashboard UI (L1 Screen)
This architecture follows a clean, modular approach ensuring scalability, testability, and maintainability.

1. Presentation Layer (SwiftUI Views)
    â€¢    Handles UI and user interactions.
    â€¢    Uses ViewModels (MVVM) to separate UI logic.
    â€¢    Leverages Combine for state management.
2. Business Logic Layer (Use Cases)
    â€¢    Manages business logic and application flow.
    â€¢    Bridges between ViewModel and Data layer.
    â€¢    Uses protocols for dependency injection and testability.
3. Data Layer (Repository & Data Sources)
    â€¢    Fetches data from Local (CoreData, Cache) or Remote (APIs, AEM, SPM Services).
    â€¢    Uses Repository Pattern for abstraction.
4. Network & External Dependencies
    â€¢    AEM Content APIs (Adobe Experience Manager).
    â€¢    Swift Package Manager (SPM) for modularity.
    â€¢    Third-party dependencies (Alamofire for networking, SwiftUICharts for visualization).

Features, Requirements, and Module Breakdown for Benefits & Coverage Dashboard UI
This document outlines the feature set, requirements, and module structure for the Benefits & Coverage Dashboard UI (L1 Screen) in a mobile app, ensuring a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Feature Set
ðŸŸ¢ Core Features:
    1    Proxy View & Selection List
    â—¦    Users can select a proxy profile (e.g., family member, dependent).
    â—¦    Displays a list of available profiles.
    â—¦    Adheres to accessibility & ADM compliance.
    2    Understand Your Plan (Benefits Summary)
    â—¦    Summarizes medical, dental, vision, and wellness benefits.
    â—¦    Displays deductibles, copays, and coverage limits.
    â—¦    Provides an interactive benefits breakdown.
    3    Dynamic Benefits Banner (AEM Integration)
    â—¦    Pulls personalized content from Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
    â—¦    Supports real-time updates based on user profile.
    â—¦    Provides fallback content if AEM data is unavailable.
    4    Find Costs for Care Services
    â—¦    Users can search for healthcare services and view estimated costs.
    â—¦    Provides a breakdown of coverage vs. out-of-pocket expenses.
    â—¦    Integrates with provider search for booking services.
    5    Error Handling & State Management
    â—¦    Supports loading, success, empty, and error states.
    â—¦    Displays error messages with retry options.
    â—¦    Uses Combine for state management in SwiftUI.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Requirements & Compliance
âœ… Functional Requirements:
    â€¢    Data Fetching: Uses REST API (Alamofire) or GraphQL.
    â€¢    State Management: Uses Combine for reactivity.
    â€¢    Caching & Performance: Implements CoreData/UserDefaults caching.
    â€¢    Security & Compliance: Adheres to ADM & HIPAA standards.
âœ… Non-Functional Requirements:
    â€¢    Performance: Ensures a fast, responsive UI with minimal load time.
    â€¢    Scalability: Uses modular components for easy expansion.
    â€¢    Maintainability: Follows MVVM + Repository Pattern.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Modules & Layered Architecture
ðŸ“Œ Module Breakdown
Module
Description
Dependencies
UI (SwiftUI Views)
Proxy selection, benefits summary, banners, and cost estimator views.
SwiftUI, Combine
ViewModel (MVVM)

Tools & Access Control for Modules in Benefits & Coverage Dashboard
To ensure scalability, security, and maintainability, we define clear module access levels and tooling for development, testing, and deployment.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Module Access Control
We structure the project into public, internal, and private modules:
Module
Access Level
Purpose
Core (Networking, UI, Utilities)
Public
Shared across all feature modules
Benefits Module
Internal
Only accessible within the Benefits domain
Proxy Selection Module
Internal
Used for profile proxy handling
Cost Estimation Module
Internal
Provides cost insights for users
AEM Content Module
Internal
Manages AEM-driven banners & dynamic UI
Third-Party Integrations
Private
Restricted to internal SDK wrappers
ðŸ“Œ Enforcing Access in Code
    â€¢    Use public only when a module needs to be accessed across different feature modules.
    â€¢    Use internal (default) for modules that should only be accessed within the same package.
    â€¢    Use private for sensitive data models or helper functions.
Example:
swift
CopyEdit
// Benefits Module - Internal Access
internal class BenefitsRepository {
    // This repository is only accessible inside Benefits module
}

ðŸ”¹ 2. Swift Package Manager (SPM) for Dependency Management
We use SPM to manage module dependencies instead of CocoaPods for better integration and security.
ðŸ“Œ Defining Dependencies in Package.swift
swift
CopyEdit
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", from: "5.6.2"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/realm/realm-swift.git", from: "10.20.1"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-composable-architecture.git", from: "0.51.0")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "Benefits",
        dependencies: ["Networking"]
    ),
    .target(
        name: "ProxySelection",
        dependencies: []
    )
]
ðŸ“Œ Adding Modules to Xcode
    1    Go to File > Add Packages...
    2    Enter the repository URL for each module.
    3    Choose the dependency rule (Up to Next Major Version recommended).
    4    Select targets where the package should be added.
